NOTE ---> Express-rate-limit module is a middleware for Express which is used to
limit repeated requests to public APIs and/or endpoints such as password reset.
By limiting the number of requests to the server, we can prevent the Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack.
It is the type of attack in which the server is flooded with repeated requests making it
unavailable to its intended users and ultimately shutting it down.



Note- helmet is a Node.js module that helps in securing ‘express’ applications by setting various HTTP headers.
It helps in mitigating cross-site scripting attacks, misissued SSL certificates etc.

NOTE-->
The serialize() method puts the execution mode into serialized mode. 
It means that only one statement can execute at a time.
Other statements will wait in a queue until all the previous statements are executed.
